`mae` collects Prometheus metrics from your Mesos apps.

See [Deployment Strategy](#deployment-strategy) to learn how to set up `mae` on your Mesos cluster.

## Requirements

`mae` requires Python (>= 2.7), and supports Python 3 (>= 3.5).

## Installation

```
pip install mae
```

## Usage
```
$ mae --help

usage: mae [-h] app_port slave_address slave_port

positional arguments:
  app_port       Port on which this exporter will run on
  slave_address  Mesos slave address
  slave_port     Mesos slave port
```
The logging level of the CLI can also be configured with the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. Read the [`logging` library's levels](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#logging-levels) for all the available levels.

## Task Labels

Once `mae` is up and running, it will start collecting metrics from all apps that have the `prometheus.metrics.enabled` label. You can also customize how the metrics are collected  â€”

| [Task Label](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.7/usage/tutorials/task-labels/)                           	| Description                                                                                                              	| Required? 	| Default    	|
|---------------------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-----------	|------------	|
| `prometheus.metrics.enabled`    	| Enables metrics collection. If the label isn't found, the app's metrics are not collected.                               	| Yes       	|            	|
| `prometheus.metrics.port_index` 	| The port index where your app is exposing its Prometheus metrics. This is useful for Mesos apps that use multiple ports. 	| No        	| `0`        	|
| `prometheus.metrics.endpoint`   	| The endpoint where your app is exposing its metrics.                                                                     	| No        	| `/metrics` 	|

## Deployment Strategy

`mae` is designed to be run as a daemon on all Mesos slave nodes. This ideally involves 2 steps â€”

1. [Install `mae`](#installation) as part of your base image/AMI or via [user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html).
2. Run `mae` as a daemon. For example, if your distro supports `systemd`, here's a sample script that runs the exporter on port `8888` â€”
    ```
    # Save this to /etc/systemd/system/mae.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Mesos App Exporter
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    Restart=on-failure
    Environment="LOG_LEVEL=INFO"
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mae 8888 localhost 5051 # Assuming the Mesos slave process is running on port 5051

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
